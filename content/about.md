Hello and welcome to my site. My name is Ronojoy. I am a professor of physics at [The Institute of Mathematical Sciences](www.imsc.res.in) in the sunny city of [Chennai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai), India. In my research, I apply techniques of statistical physics to study soft materials. Wearing another hat, I use
Bayesian inference and machine learning to analyse data. Computation is an essential part of both these themes of research. 

This weblog centers on science, inference, and computation, but makes occasional forays into other topics that catch my interest. The name *maxent* derives from the principle of maximum entropy, a method of reasoning under uncertainty with the least amount of bias. I keep my writing as free of bias as is consciously possible - I hope you enjoy reading through.
